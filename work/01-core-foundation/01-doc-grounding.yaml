summary: Align the implementation plan to the Kids Draw design doc and lock scope boundaries.
context:
  - This anchors all subsequent tasks to the design spec so tile caching, hot layer, and commit flows are consistent from day one.
  - Avoids drift from ad‑hoc assumptions during implementation.
prerequisites:
  - Read docs/thinking/kids_draw/design.md
acceptance_criteria:
  - A short checklist of agreed design decisions is added to the work/ directory for reference.
  - All tests/typecheck/lint pass:
    - mise run test:all
    - mise run ts:check:all
    - mise run lint:all
  - mise run validate:all
notes:
  - Checklist should include tile size, hot-layer behavior, and per-shape touched-tiles invalidation approach.
  - No code changes required in this task.
